## My Solution on problems on projecteuler.net

Feel free to use these as references but please be warned that I'm still learning so some uses of the language or some solutions may be really wrong. 
I may revisit this project frequently for a while for update.
For my fellow coders, problem-solver who came here, have a good day!
